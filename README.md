# React_js

"Hey LinkedIn community! ðŸ‘‹ I'm excited to share a project I recently completedâ€”a Bollywood Netflix movie card built using React, plain CSS, and Bootstrap! ðŸŽ¥

One of the cool features? If a movie's rating is above 8, the card background changes to red to highlight superhit movies! ðŸ”¥ I also added a special LinkedIn caption just for fun. Styling was done using plain CSS and Bootstrap for responsiveness.

This project was a great way to dive deeper into conditional rendering in React while keeping things simple with plain CSS and Bootstrap. ðŸ’»

Check out the details below, and feel free to share your thoughts or feedback! I'd love to hear any suggestions for improvement, or if you'd like to collaborate on future projects.

Thanks to everyone in the LinkedIn community for the constant inspiration and support! Let's keep building and learning together.
